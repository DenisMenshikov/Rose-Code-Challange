# Rose-Code-Challange

var x instead of = r * cos(a) now = (r+15) * cos(a).
- this just translates it horizontaly

var y instead of = r * sin(a) now = (r*1.2) * sin(a).
- this stretches the rose vertically

vertex(x+sin(x), y) is now vertex(x+sin(x^2), y)
- this moves the vertext around a small radius around the center of the page.
